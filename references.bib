This organization is accomplished by mining the complex biological co-occurrences found in multiple sources of functional annotation. It is a powerful method to group functionally related genes and terms into a manageable number of biological modules for efficient interpretation of gene lists in a network context.",

	abstract = {The composition and density of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment profoundly influence tumor progression and success of anti-cancer therapies. Flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry staining, or single-cell sequencing is usually not available such that we rely on computational methods to estimate the immune-cell composition from bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data. Various methods have been proposed recently, yet their capabilities and limitations have not been evaluated systematically. A general guideline leading the research community through cell type deconvolution is missing. We developed a systematic approach for benchmarking such computational methods and assessed the accuracy of tools for estimating a variety of immune cell types from bulk RNA-seq samples. We used a single-cell RNA-seq dataset of ~11,000 cells from the tumor microenvironment to simulate bulk samples of known cell type proportions, which allowed us to measure the accuracy of the computational methods. Moreover, we collected publicly available data that provide both RNA-seq and independent, gold-standard estimates of the cell type proportions. This allowed us to analyze and condense the results of a hundred of thousand predictions to provide an exhaustive evaluation across computational methods over ten cell types and ~1,400 samples from five simulated and real-world datasets. We demonstrate that computational deconvolution performs at high accuracy for well-defined high-quality signatures, demonstrating its practical utility of bulk RNA-seq to dissect immune-cell composition of tumor samples. In addition to guidelines for method selection (depending on the cell types of interest) we also offer an R package to allow the community to perform integrated deconvolution using different methods themselves (https://grst.github.io/immunedeconv). We suggest that future efforts should be dedicated to refining cell population definitions and finding reliable signatures.},

@article{Wu2012,
	abstract = {Competitive gene set tests are commonly used in molecular pathway analysis to test for enrichment of a particular gene annotation category amongst the differential expression results from a microarray experiment. Existing gene set tests that rely on gene permutation are shown here to be extremely sensitive to inter-gene correlation. Several data sets are analyzed to show that inter-gene correlation is non-ignorable even for experiments on homogeneous cell populations using genetically identical model organisms. A new gene set test procedure (CAMERA) is proposed based on the idea of estimating the inter-gene correlation from the data, and using it to adjust the gene set test statistic. An efficient procedure is developed for estimating the inter-gene correlation and characterizing its precision. CAMERA is shown to control the type I error rate correctly regardless of inter-gene correlations, yet retains excellent power for detecting genuine differential expression. Analysis of breast cancer data shows that CAMERA recovers known relationships between tumor subtypes in very convincing terms. CAMERA can be used to analyze specified sets or as a pathway analysis tool using a database of molecular signatures.},

	abstract = "The main approach of traditional information retrieval (IR) is to examine how many words from a query appear in a document. A drawback of this approach, however, is that it may fail to detect relevant documents where no or only few words from a query are found. The semantic analysis methods such as LSA (latent semantic analysis) and LDA (latent Dirichlet allocation) have been proposed to address the issue, but their performance is not superior compared to common IR approaches. Here we present a query-document similarity measure motivated by the Word Mover’s Distance. Unlike other similarity measures, the proposed method relies on neural word embeddings to compute the distance between words. This process helps identify related words when no direct matches are found between a query and a document. Our method is efficient and straightforward to implement. The experimental results on TREC Genomics data show that our approach outperforms the BM25 ranking function by an average of 12% in mean average precision. Furthermore, for a real-world dataset collected from the PubMed® search logs, we combine the semantic measure with BM25 using a learning to rank method, which leads to improved ranking scores by up to 25%. This experiment demonstrates that the proposed approach and BM25 nicely complement each other and together produce superior performance."

	abstract = "The shortest path problem is of great importance to the real world in such areas as transportation, network design, telecommunication, etc. The deterministic version of the problem is easily solved. However, in the real world, uncertainty is frequently encountered and must be dealt with. For instance, in a transportation network, the path that has the least travel time when no traffic is present might be prone to accidents and traffic jams, and thus it may lead to a drastic increase in travel time during rush hours. In situations with significant uncertainty, the deterministic approach can be far from sufficient. New and appropriate criteria and models to handle uncertainties along with efficient solution techniques are in need. In this paper, we take a minimax approach to measure the performance under uncertainties. Under our measure, one path is superior to all others only if its worst case performance is better than that of the others. The complexity of the defined models, exact and heuristic solution methods are explored and presented. Analysis is done to examine the performance of the heuristic method. The shortest path (SP) problem in a network with nonnegative arc lengths can be solved easily by Dijkstra's labeling algorithm in polynomial time. In the case of significant uncertainty of the arc lengths, a robustness approach is more appropriate. In this paper, we study the SP problem under arc length uncertainties. A scenario approach is adopted to characterize uncertainties. Two robustness criteria are specified: the absolute robust criterion and the robust deviation criterion. We show that under both criteria the robust SP problem is NP-complete even for the much more restricted layered networks of width 2, and with only 2 scenarios. A pseudo-polynomial algorithm is devised to solve the robust SP problem in general networks under bounded number of scenarios. Also presented is a more efficient algorithm for layered networks. However, in the case of unlimited number of scenarios, we show that the robust SP problem is strongly NP-hard. A simple heuristic for finding a good robust shortest path is provided, and the worst case performance is analyzed."

	abstract = {Abstract A correlation analysis provides a quantifiable value and direction for the relationship between the two variables, but the output generated cannot determine cause and effect. The two commonly used correlation analyses are Pearson's correlation (parametric) and Spearman's rank-order correlation (nonparametric). The Pearson and Spearman analyses provide the researcher with a p-value (i.e., significance level) and an r-or p-value (i.e., strength of the relationship). This chapter discusses the assumptions of the correlation analysis in more depth. The following assumptions must be satisfied in order to run Pearson's and Spearman's correlation: data type; distribution of data; and random sampling. The chapter further compares Pearson's and Spearman's tests. Statistical programs are used to run a correlation analysis to determine a significant relationship (p-value) and the strength of the relationship (r, ρ).}

In supertree construction, however, the source data represent phylogenetic trees rather than primary character data. This presents several supertree-specific problems. In this paper, we examine several key data issues for supertree construction, including data set non-independence, taxonomy of terminal taxa, and the question of what constitutes a valid source tree. Throughout, we present our suggested protocol for source tree collection and manipulation based on our experiences in building a supertree of mammals. Other protocols and decisions are naturally possible. What is important is that all collection protocols are presented explicitly and address minimally the issues that we have identified.",
