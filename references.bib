It is a powerful method to group functionally related genes and terms into a manageable number of biological modules for efficient interpretation of gene lists in a network context.",

	abstract = {The composition and density of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment profoundly influence tumor progression and success of anti-cancer therapies. Flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry staining, or single-cell sequencing is usually not available such that we rely on computational methods to estimate the immune-cell composition from bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data. Various methods have been proposed recently, yet their capabilities and limitations have not been evaluated systematically. A general guideline leading the research community through cell type deconvolution is missing. We developed a systematic approach for benchmarking such computational methods and assessed the accuracy of tools for estimating a variety of immune cell types from bulk RNA-seq samples. We used a single-cell RNA-seq dataset of ~11,000 cells from the tumor microenvironment to simulate bulk samples of known cell type proportions, which allowed us to measure the accuracy of the computational methods. Moreover, we collected publicly available data that provide both RNA-seq and independent, gold-standard estimates of the cell type proportions. This allowed us to analyze and condense the results of a hundred of thousand predictions to provide an exhaustive evaluation across computational methods over ten cell types and ~1,400 samples from five simulated and real-world datasets. We demonstrate that computational deconvolution performs at high accuracy for well-defined high-quality signatures, demonstrating its practical utility of bulk RNA-seq to dissect immune-cell composition of tumor samples. In addition to guidelines for method selection (depending on the cell types of interest) we also offer an R package to allow the community to perform integrated deconvolution using different methods themselves (https://grst.github.io/immunedeconv). We suggest that future efforts should be dedicated to refining cell population definitions and finding reliable signatures.},

@article{Wu2012,
	abstract = {Competitive gene set tests are commonly used in molecular pathway analysis to test for enrichment of a particular gene annotation category amongst the differential expression results from a microarray experiment. Existing gene set tests that rely on gene permutation are shown here to be extremely sensitive to inter-gene correlation. Several data sets are analyzed to show that inter-gene correlation is non-ignorable even for experiments on homogeneous cell populations using genetically identical model organisms. A new gene set test procedure (CAMERA) is proposed based on the idea of estimating the inter-gene correlation from the data, and using it to adjust the gene set test statistic. An efficient procedure is developed for estimating the inter-gene correlation and characterizing its precision. CAMERA is shown to control the type I error rate correctly regardless of inter-gene correlations, yet retains excellent power for detecting genuine differential expression. Analysis of breast cancer data shows that CAMERA recovers known relationships between tumor subtypes in very convincing terms. CAMERA can be used to analyze specified sets or as a pathway analysis tool using a database of molecular signatures.},
