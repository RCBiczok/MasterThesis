%Recap on your thesis. It has been a long journey if the reader has made it this far. Remind the reader what the big picture was. Briefly outline your thesis, motivation, problem, and proposed solution.

%Now the most important part, draw conclusions based on your analysis. Did your proposed solution work? What are the strong points? What are the limitations?

%Significant issues identified in the thesis, or still outstanding after the thesis, should be describe as future work.
